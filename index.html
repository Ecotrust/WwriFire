 <h1>Whole Watershed Restoration Initiative</h1>
 <p>The Whole Watershed Restoration Initiative is a public-private competitive grant program that focuses on salmon habitat restoration efforts in areas of high ecological importance in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.</p>
    <h3>Where We Work</h3>
    <p>Together the partners first identify Priority Basins and Focus Watersheds in the Pacific Northwest that have the highest ecological values and potential responsiveness to restoration efforts. Weprovide funding for projects in these areas that aim to restore and protect major ecological functions by removing risk factors and restoring damaged habitat-forming processes in the watershed. Once the work restoring major ecological processes is completed within an individual Focus Watershed, restoration efforts and funding will then be concentrated on other areas; thus the geographic focus will change over time. </p>
    <p>Initial priority areas were identified using Ecotrust's <a href="http://www.pacificwatersheds.net/priorities">conservation planning priorities tool</a> combined with outputs from the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Region <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/wwri/downloads/R6AquaticBasinRestoration.pdf">Basin-scale Restoration Prioritization Process</a>. The current WWRI working geography includes twenty-eight Focus Watersheds within nine Priority Basins across Oregon, Washington and Idaho.

    <p>Each year the WWRI supports restoration projects with between $1 and $2 million in grant funds. Projects funded to date range from dam and culvert removal to re-establishing river flow patterns and restoring riparian areas to road decommissioning. Successful projects improve the health of streams and anadromous fish while engaging and building capacity in local communities. Grantees include tribes, local governments, non-profit organizations such as watershed councils and Soil and Water Conservation Districts, educational institutions, and other non-governmental community groups. Federal agencies also receive grant funds, often in partnership with non-federal local organizations.</p>
    <h3>Requests for Proposals</h3>
    <p>Proposals for 2012 WWRI funding are now being solicited. Applications are due December 15, 2011 at 5:00 pm PST.</p>

  <ul class="default">
    <li>382 miles of rivers and streams have been re-opened to anadromous fish since 2008.</li>
    <li>1,500 hours of family-wage work are generated, on average, with each funded project.</li>
    <li>More than 4,600 acres of habitat are projected to be restored from projects started during 2008 to 2010.</li>
    <li>Over 5,160 volunteer hours have been contributed to WWRI projects by local citizens in four years.</li>
    <li>Seventeen independent films were submitted to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ecotrust"><em>Stories From Our Watersheds</em></a> Film Contest in 2010, giving us insight — beyond numbers — into what watershed restoration means to local communities.</li>
